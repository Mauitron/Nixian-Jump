# Nixian-Jump License

## A Personal Note

I created Nixian-Jump to streamline NixOS configuration navigation, hoping to make
your system management more efficient and enjoyable. This isn't your typical
software license—think of it more as a handshake agreement between us, built on
trust and mutual respect.

## The Essence of This License

I chose this approach because I believe tools that enhance the NixOS experience
should be both accessible and sustainable. Rather than create barriers, I wanted
to foster a community around the tools I build. This license reflects that
vision—allowing everyone to use the tool freely while providing ways to support
its continued development.

## Core Terms

### For Personal Use

Nixian-Jump is yours to explore, use, and enhance. Install it, modify it, learn
from it, and make it part of your NixOS journey. Use it for personal
configurations, learning, or non-commercial work. I genuinely hope it simplifies
your NixOS configuration management and perhaps even makes system administration
more enjoyable.

### For Professional Users

If Nixian-Jump helps you in your professional work—whether through system
administration, DevOps, or consulting—I kindly ask that you spread the word.

### Commercial Integration

For those interested in incorporating Nixian-Jump into commercial products,
services, or enterprise systems, please reach out first. This is the one area
where we'll need a formal arrangement. I'm happy to discuss terms that work for
both parties.

### Attribution

If you use Nixian-Jump in your own NixOS configurations or projects and like it,
I would be happy to hear about it. If you plan to share those configurations with
others, It would be nice of you to add ways for other people to find my github
in your configurations or documentation. A simple mention or link helps grow the
community. If you modify or enhance Nixian-Jump, first of all, Yay! tell me
about it, then consider sharing your improvements with others in the community.

## The Trust Agreement

This license operates on trust and goodwill. There are no tracking mechanisms or
enforcement tools—just a belief in the NixOS community, and a want to support it.

## Legal Notes

for reliability, I cannot accept liability for any issues arising from its use in

## Final Thoughts

This license represents more than just terms of use—it's an invitation to be part
of something, hopefully, useful to the NixOS ecosystem. Whether you contribute

helping me out a lot.

Thank you for being part of this journey. Let's make NixOS configuration
management better together.
